# Exploratory Study of _Ixodes_ Phylogeny and Species Distribution in Canada

## Intro
As global warming continues, species previously confined to warmer regions due to climate limitations are migrating towards previously colder areas. _Ixodes spp._ (commonly known as ticks) are a major taxon of concern for this migrational trend due to their potential to carry a variety of tick-borne diseases in urban areas (Rizzoli et al., 2014). One such disease, Lyme disease, is transferred by _Ixodes spp._ carrying the bacteria _Borrelia burgdorferi_. Although few incidences of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ have been detected in _Ixodes spp._ outside of _Ixodes scapularis_, closely related or variant species of _Ixodes_ may become able to host the same pathogen due to genetic similarities. Additionally, as _Borrelia burgdorferi_ can be transferred between ticks through consumption of the same infected food source, close proximity and resource sharing between sister species may allow the bacterium to adapt to and infect a new host. With global warming expanding the range of _Ixodes spp._, it becomes important to conduct geophylogeny analysis to determine the proximity of closely related _Ixodes spp._ and understand the risk of zoonotic spillover to sister species. Overall, this exploratory report aims to determine the proximity of closely related _Ixodes spp._ in Canada and aims to evaluate the risk of a new _Ixodes_ host for _Borrelia burgdorferi_ due to phylogenetic and geographic nearness.

## Methods
First, alignment was completed with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004), a widely used and powerful alignment algorithm. Construction of phylogenies was completed with DECIPHER clustering (Wright, 2016), Maximum Likelihood (with neighbor-joining), and the highest-ranked model from ModelTest (both from the phangorn library; Schllep, 2011). Final geophylogeny plotting was performed only with DECIPHER cluster data and completed with phytools (Revell, 2012). Preferentially, we would have used a more powerful algorithm such as Maximum Likelihood or ModelTest that is able to model non-uniform evolutionary time, but we were unable to convert the output datatypes to the ones required for the mapping graphic. Instead, we simply use these additional phylogenies for comparison after initial analysis of species distribution on our map graphic. Consequently, one major weakness of the phytools package for geophylogeny mapping is the poor support for other common phylogeny data types such as pml and non-uniform length phylogenies.

## Results
Overall, we determine that the greatest species of concern for gaining the ability to host _Borrelia burgdorferi_ is _Ixodes muris_. However, it is necessary to confirm phylogenetic relationships between _Ixodes spp._ in Canada more rigorously by incorporating additional evolutionary marker genes. 

In our analysis, we examined the genetic similarity between different species of _Ixodes_ in Canada and further mapped these species to determine the proximity between related species of _Ixodes_. We can see from the final figure (below) that most species found in close proximity to our major species of concern (_Ixodes scapularis_ as represented in yellow), such as _Ixodes kingi_, _Ixodes texanus_, and _Ixodes gregsoni_, are generally more distant in relation to _Ixodes scapularis_ within the taxon. However, _Ixodes muris_ being in the same clade as well as geological neighbors with _Ixodes scapularis_ represents an area of concern. It may be possible that this species can also carry the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ bacterium due to genetic similarities and may do so soon if they are frequently in the same area and share the same _Borrelia burgdorferi_ infected food source as _Ixodes scapularis_. Similarly, our standard bootstrap phylogeny also supports this conclusion as it also suggests a close phylogenetic relationship between _Ixodes scapularis_ and _Ixodes muris_. On the other hand, our optimized maximum likelihood phylogeny suggests instead that _Ixodes scapularis_ is quite genetically different from other _Ixodes_ species, thus proximity should not be cause for concern.
